abstract = {Using hand-collected data on divisional managers at S\&P 500 firms, we study their role in internal capital budgeting. Divisionalmanagers with social connections to the CEO receive more capital. Connections to the CEO outweigh measures of managersâ€™ formal influence, such as seniority and board membership, and affect both manage- rial appointments and capital allocations. The effect of connections on investment efficiency depends on the tradeoff between agency and information asymmetry. Un- der weak governance, connections reduce investment efficiency and firm value via favoritism. Under high information asymmetry, connections increase investment ef- ficiency and firm value via information transfer. DIVISIONAL},

abstract = {This paper applies a value-based management framework to critically review empirical research in managerial accounting. This framework enables us to place the exceptionally diverse set of managerial accounting studies from the past several decades into an integrated structure. Our synthesis highlights the many consistent results in prior research, identifies remaining gaps and inconsistencies, discusses common methodological and econometric problems, and suggests fruitful avenues for future managerial accounting research. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Rajan2000,
abstract = {We model the distortions that internal power struggles can generate in the allocation of resources between divisions of a diversified firm. The model predicts that if divisions are similar in the level of their resources and opportunities, funds will be transferred from divisions with poor opportunities to divisions with good opportunities. When diversity in resources and opportunities increases, however, resources can flow toward the most inefficient division, leading to more inefficient investment and less valuable firms. We test these predictions on a panel of diversified U.S. firms during the period from 1980 to 1993 and find evidence consistent with them.},

@article{Zimmerman2001,
abstract = {The empirical managerial accounting literature has failed to produce a substantive cumulative body of knowledge. This literature has not matured beyond describing practice to developing and testing theories explaining observed practice, like other areas of accounting research. While the lack of publicly available data is a popular reason for this literature's underdeveloped state, it is not the only one. Other conjectures include: its inductive approach, researchers' incentives, its use of non-economics-based frameworks, the lack of empirically testable theories, and its emphasis on decision making, not control. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Bernardo2004,
abstract = {We examine optimal capital allocation and managerial compensation in a firm with two investment projects (divisions) each run by a risk-neutral manager who can provide (i) (unverifiable) information about project quality and (ii) (unverifiable) access to value-enhancing, but privately costly resources. The optimal managerial compensation contract offers greater performance pay and a lower salary when managers report that their project is higher quality. The firm generally underinvests in capital and managers underutilize resources (relative to first-best). We also derive cross-sectional predictions about the sensitivity of investment in one division to the quality of investment opportunities in the other division, and the relative importance of division-level and firm-level performance-based pay in managerial compensation contracts.
