abstract = {When the Revelation Principle (RP) holds, managing earnings confers no advantage over revelation. We construct an explanation for earnings management that is based on limitations on owners’ ability to make commitments (a violation of the RP’s assumptions). Traditionally, earnings management is seen as sneaky managers pulling the wool over the eyes of gullible owners by manipulating accruals; our limited commitment story suggests that the owners, too, can benefit from earnings management. We categorize a variety of extant explanations of earnings management, along with our own, according to which of the assumptions of the RP each explanation violates. Plausibility of multiple simultaneous violations of the assumptions, and strategic use of various accounting and real instruments of earnings management, complicate the task of detecting such management in field data.},

@article{Schipper1989,
abstract = {This article presents a commentary on earnings management and associated accounting practices. The commentary is intended to provide a framework for thinking about the implications of research design choices in earnings management research, to demonstrate some tradeoffs involved in making those choices, and to describe the connection between earnings management research and some other areas of accounting research. According to the author, although the variety of accrual options available under generally accepted accounting principles and the susceptibility of accruals to manipulation mean that the resulting accounting numbers could in principle be managed to the point of uninformativeness, available empirical evidence indicates that accruals do in fact have information content. The author focuses on three issues: defining the object of earnings management; exploring conditions giving rise to earnings management; and designing empirical tests of earnings management. Under an informational perspective, earnings are one of many signals which may be used to make certain decisions and judgments, such as, the decision in the valuation of securities. The informational perspective on earnings management assumes that managers have private information which they can use in making accounting decisions.},

@article{Dechow2000,
abstract = {We address the fact that accounting academics often have very different perceptions of earnings management than do practitioners and regulators. Practitioners and regulators often see earnings management as pervasive and problematic--and in need of immediate remedial action. Academics are more sanguine, unwilling to believe that earnings management is actively practiced by most firms or that the earnings management that does exist should necessarily concern investors. We explore the reasons for these different perceptions, and argue that each of these groups may benefit from some rethinking of their views about earnings management.
