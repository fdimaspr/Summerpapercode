abstract = {I review empirical research on the relation between capital markets and financial $\backslash$nstatements.The principal sources of demand for capital markets research in accounting $\backslash$nare fundamental analysis and valuation, tests of market efficiency, and the role of $\backslash$naccounting numbers in contracts and the political process.The capital markets research $\backslash$ntopics of current interest to researchers include tests of market efficiency with respect to $\backslash$naccounting information, fundamental analysis, and value relevance of financial $\backslash$nreporting.Evidence from research on these topics is likely to be helpful in capital $\backslash$nmarket investment decisions, accounting standard setting, and corporate financial $\backslash$ndisclosure decisions.},
