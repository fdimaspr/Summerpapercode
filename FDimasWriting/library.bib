@book{Holthausen1995,
abstract = {Using confidential data of executive-specific short-term bonus plans, we investigate the extent to which executives manipulate earnings to maximize the present value of bonus plan payments. As such, this paper extends the work of Healy (1985). Like Healy, we find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that managers manipulate earnings downwards when their bonuses are at their maximum. Unlike Healy, we find no evidence that managers manipulate earnings downwards when earnings are below the minimum necessary to receive any bonus. We demonstrate that Healy's results at the lower bound are likely to be induced by his methodology.

abstract = {We investigate whether earnings guidance affects aggregate stock returns through its effects on expectations about overall earnings performance and/or aggregate expected returns. We find that aggregate guidance, especially relative levels of quarterly downward guidance, is associated with analyst- and time-series-based measures of aggregate earnings news. We find more modest evidence that guidance, again, largely downward guidance, is associated with market returns-market returns appear to respond to guidance toward the end of each calendar quarter, when most earnings preannouncements are released, and there is some evidence that firm-level guidance affects market returns in short windows around its release. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We examine the link between Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring and yield spreads on private firms' 144A bond issues. After controlling for security-specific and other firm-specific determinants, we provide evidence that debt financing is cheaper when the probability of a face-to-face IRS audit is higher. Consistent with another prediction, we find that IRS oversight has a stronger impact on bond pricing for private firms with high ownership concentration, which suffer worse agency problems between controlling shareholders and outside investors. Collectively, our research implies that IRS monitoring plays a valuable corporate governance role by reducing information asymmetry evident in borrowing costs. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bushman2012,
abstract = { This paper investigates associations between top management team incentive dispersion and firm value/performance. We conceptualize team incentive dispersion as arising from the intricate structure of relations across executivesâ individual pay packages. Our central focus is on dispersion in pay-performance sensitivities (PPS) across top executives. While existing theory demonstrates that variation in PPS across team members can be optimal, we find that PPS dispersion is negatively associated with firm value as measured by Tobinâs Q and with operating performance (ROA). Further, we find that PPS dispersion significantly weakens the positive effects of both tournament incentives and average team PPS, and significantly exacerbates the negative performance implications associated with CEO pay slice. We conjecture that PPS dispersion promotes free-riding behavior that interferes with executivesâ incentives to cooperate. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the negative effects of PPS dispersion are weakened as the duration of the teamâs tenure increases or as firm complexity decreases, suggesting that improved (or better) cooperation within the management team over time (or cross firms) offsets the deleterious effects of PPS dispersion.},

abstract = {We examine the impact of differential incentives arising from proximity to debt covenant violation on earnings management. We reason that firms with loans close to violation or in technical default of their debt covenants have a stronger incentive to engage in earnings management than firms that are far from violating their debt covenants. We find results consistent with this expectation. Firms close to violation or in technical default of their debt covenants engage in higher levels of accounting earnings management, real earnings management, and total earnings management than far-from-violation firms. In additional analysis, we find that firms with a stronger incentive to avoid covenant violation switched from using more accounting earnings management before the SarbanesâOxley Act to using more real earnings management and more total earnings management afterwards. We also document that the earnings management implications of debt covenant violation are observed primarily for firms with poor credit ratings and for firms that do not meet analyst forecasts.},

@article{Schipper1989,
abstract = {This article presents a commentary on earnings management and associated accounting practices. The commentary is intended to provide a framework for thinking about the implications of research design choices in earnings management research, to demonstrate some tradeoffs involved in making those choices, and to describe the connection between earnings management research and some other areas of accounting research. According to the author, although the variety of accrual options available under generally accepted accounting principles and the susceptibility of accruals to manipulation mean that the resulting accounting numbers could in principle be managed to the point of uninformativeness, available empirical evidence indicates that accruals do in fact have information content. The author focuses on three issues: defining the object of earnings management; exploring conditions giving rise to earnings management; and designing empirical tests of earnings management. Under an informational perspective, earnings are one of many signals which may be used to make certain decisions and judgments, such as, the decision in the valuation of securities. The informational perspective on earnings management assumes that managers have private information which they can use in making accounting decisions.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the borrower's abnormal loan announcement return and the bank's loan screening and monitoring using a new ex-ante proxy for loan screening and monitoring. While recent studies have suggested that bank loan relationships and related loan screening and monitoring services may no longer matter, we find significant loan announcement returns over the 1995-1999 period and, controlling for borrower and loan characteristics, a statistically significant positive relationship between the proxy and the borrower's standardized CAR. While consistent with a bank's loan screening and monitoring adding value to the borrower, the economic effect is relatively small. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We study the stock price reaction to news about corporate tax aggressiveness. We find that, on average, a company's stock price declines when there is news about its involvement in tax shelters. We find some limited evidence for cross-sectional variation in the reaction. For example, the reaction is more negative for firms in the retail sector, suggesting that part of the reaction may be a consumer/taxpayer backlash. In addition, the reaction is less negative for firms that are viewed to be generally less tax aggressive, as proxied by the firm's cash effective tax rate. We interpret this as being consistent with the market reacting positively to evidence that a firm is trying to reduce taxes when their financial reports would lead one to believe the firm is not tax aggressive. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study uses Ohlsonâs (1995 and 2001) accounting-based equity $\backslash$nvaluation model to structure tests of four explanations for the anomalously posi- $\backslash$ntive pricing of dividends reported by Rees (1997) and Fama and French (1998). $\backslash$nFirst, we find that dividends are not simply a proxy for publicly available informa- $\backslash$ntion that helps predict future abnormal earnings. Second, although dividends act $\backslash$nas if they signal managersâ private information about future profitability, they $\backslash$nremain positively priced for firms with low incentives to signal. Third, dividends $\backslash$ndo not signal managementâs willingness to abstain from incurring agency costs. $\backslash$nFourth, however, controlling for one-year-ahead realized forecast errors yields a $\backslash$npricing of dividends that is very close to that of dividend displacement. After $\backslash$nshowing that dividends are not simply a proxy for analystsâ misforecasting, we $\backslash$nconclude that dividends appear to bepositively priced because they are a proxy for $\backslash$nthemispricing by investors of current earnings or book equity.},

abstract = {In this section we have attempted to apply and to test the model of valuation developed in Sections I and II of this paper. Strong support has been presented for our contention that the usual direct least-squares value equations (and yield-form equations) lead to biased estimates of the key parameters. The evidence has also been seen to be consistent with our specifications with respect to the constant terms, the value of the debt coefficient and the role of dividends. Given these specifications, the most efficient, consistent estimates of the value relation are those shown in the second panel of Table 3; and it is to the economic interpretation of these results that we now turn.

abstract = {We address the fact that accounting academics often have very different perceptions of earnings management than do practitioners and regulators. Practitioners and regulators often see earnings management as pervasive and problematic--and in need of immediate remedial action. Academics are more sanguine, unwilling to believe that earnings management is actively practiced by most firms or that the earnings management that does exist should necessarily concern investors. We explore the reasons for these different perceptions, and argue that each of these groups may benefit from some rethinking of their views about earnings management.

It states that competing explanations for post-earnings-announcement drift can be placed in two categories: price response to new information is delayed, and that researches fail to adjust raw returns fully for risk due to the use of incomplete or misestimated capital-asset-pricing models (CAPM) to calculate abnormal returns. It summarizes the current state of understanding for post-earnings-announcement drift and comments on delayed price response and CAPM misspecification to explain the drift. It examines the sample and some of the methods used in empirical tests.},

abstract = {Using hand-collected data on divisional managers at S\&P 500 firms, we study their role in internal capital budgeting. Divisionalmanagers with social connections to the CEO receive more capital. Connections to the CEO outweigh measures of managersâ formal influence, such as seniority and board membership, and affect both manage- rial appointments and capital allocations. The effect of connections on investment efficiency depends on the tradeoff between agency and information asymmetry. Un- der weak governance, connections reduce investment efficiency and firm value via favoritism. Under high information asymmetry, connections increase investment ef- ficiency and firm value via information transfer. DIVISIONAL},

@article{Minton2009,
abstract = {Before the credit crisis that started in mid-2007, it was generally believed by top regulators that credit derivatives make banks sounder. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this view. We examine the use of credit derivatives by US bank holding companies with assets in excess of one billion dollars from 1999 to 2005. Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Holding Company Database, we find that in 2005 the gross notional amount of credit derivatives held by banks exceeds the amount of loans on their books. Only 23 large banks out of 395 use credit derivatives and most of their derivatives positions are held for dealer activities rather than for hedging of loans. The net notional amount of credit derivatives used for hedging of loans in 2005 represents less than 2\% of the total notional amount of credit derivatives held by banks and less than 2\% of their loans. We conclude that the use of credit derivatives by banks to hedge loans is limited because of adverse selection and moral hazard problems and because of the inability of banks to use hedge accounting when hedging with credit derivatives. Our evidence raises important questions about the extent to which the use of credit derivatives makes banks sounder. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We predict that firms with stronger corporate governance will exhibit a higher degree of accounting conservatism. Governance level is assessed using a composite measure that incorporates several internal and external characteristics. Consistent with our prediction, strong governance firms show significantly higher levels of conditional accounting conservatism. Our tests take into account the endogenous nature of corporate governance, and the results are robust to the use of several measures of conservatism (market-based and nonmarket-based). Our evidence is consistent with the direction of causality flowing from governance to conservatism, and not vice versa, indicating that governance and conservatism are not substitutes. Finally, we study the impact of earnings discretion on the sensitivity of earnings to bad news across governance structures. We find that, on average, strong-governance firms appear to use discretionary accruals to inform investors about bad news in a timelier manner. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Additionally, distressed firms are more likely to file for bankruptcy if they are linked to CDS trading. Furthermore, firms with more "no restructuring" contracts than other types of CDS contracts (i.e., contracts that include restructuring) are more adversely affected by CDS trading, and the number of creditors increases after CDS trading begins, exacerbating creditor coordination failure in the resolution of financial distress.},

I show that, when entrepreneurs rely on the certification value of bank debt to obtain cheap bond market finance, the existence of a credit derivatives market may cause them to issue subâinvestment grade bonds instead and engage in secondâbest behavior. Credit derivatives can therefore cause disintermediation and thus reduce welfare.

abstract = {We find that firms with greater tax avoidance incur higher spreads when obtaining bank loans. This finding is robust in a battery of sensitivity analyses and in two quasi-experimental settings including the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 and the revelation of past tax sheltering activity. Firms with greater tax avoidance also incur more stringent nonprice loan terms, incur higher at-issue bond spreads, and prefer bank loans over public bonds when obtaining debt financing. Overall, these findings indicate that banks perceive tax avoidance as engendering significant risks.},

Bank regulation, together with competitive deposit and equity financing, can give banks an incentive to sell loans, but the extent of their loan selling is limited by a moral-hazard problem. A solution is given for the optimal design of the bank-loan buyer contract that alleviates this moral-hazard problem. An explanation is also given as to why some banks might buy loans and why loan sales volume has recently increased.},

The model satisfies many appealing properties, and it provides a useful benchmark when one conceptualizes how market value relates to accounting data and other information.},

@article{Keung2010,
abstract = {This study shows that firms collectively incur a cost for managing earnings and analyst expectations to meet earnings forecasts. We compare the coefficient in the regression of abnormal stock returns on earnings surprise (the earnings response coefficient ERC) across ranges of earnings surprises. The ERC for earnings surprises in the range 0, 1 is significantly lower than ERCs for earnings surprises in adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the early and mid 2000s, but not for those in the 1990s. The results are robust to controlling for the sign of estimated discretionary accruals and the trajectory of analyst earnings forecasts. We further find that investors are right to be skeptical about earnings surprises in the range 0, 1. The relation of future earnings surprise with current earnings surprise is more negative for current earnings surprises in that range than for those in any other range. Evidence also suggests analysts react negatively to earnings surprises in that range.

@article{Callen2009a,
abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of earnings on credit risk in the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market using levels, changes, and event study analyses. We find that earnings (cash flows, accruals) of reference firms are negatively and significantly correlated with the level of CDS premia, consistent with earnings (cash flows, accruals) conveying information about default risk. Based on the changes analysis, a 1 percent increase in ROA decreases CDS rates significantly by about 5 percent. We also find that (1) CDS premia are more highly correlated with below-median earnings than with above-median earnings and (2) CDS premia are more highly correlated with earnings of low-rated firms than with earnings of high-rated firms. Evidence indicates further that short-window earnings surprises are negatively and significantly correlated with CDS premia changes in the three-day window surrounding the preliminary earnings announcement, although the impact is concentrated in the shorter maturities.

We also find two forms of deviation from parity. First, for three firms, CDS prices are substantially higher than credit spreads for long periods of time, arising from combinations of imperfections in the contract specification of CDSs and measurement errors in computing the credit spread. Second, we find short-lived deviations from parity for all other companies due to a lead for CDS prices over credit spreads in the price discovery process.},

@article{Ivashina2011,
abstract = {Between 2001 and 2007, annual institutional funding in highly leveraged loans went up from \$32 billion to \$426 billion, accounting for nearly 70\% of the jump in total syndicated loan issuance over the same period. Did the inflow of institutional funding in the syndicated loan market lead to mispricing of credit? To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure defined as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we find that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower final interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund flow as an instrument. Furthermore, we find significant price differences between institutional investors' tranches and banks' tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum. While this effect is significantly larger for loan tranches bought by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), it is not fully explained by their role. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In a variety of biomedical applications, particularly those involving screening for infectious diseases, testing individuals (e.g. blood/urine samples, etc.) in pools has become a standard method of data collection. This experimental design, known as group testing (or pooled testing), can provide a large reduction in testing costs and can offer nearly the same precision as individual testing. To account for covariate information on individual subjects, regression models for group testing data have been proposed recently. However, there are currently no tools available to check the adequacy of these models. In this paper, we present various global goodness-of-fit tests for regression models with group testing data. We use simulation to examine the small-sample size and power properties of the tests for different pool composition strategies. We illustrate our methods using two infectious disease data sets, one from an HIV study in Kenya and one from the Infertility Prevention Project. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We model the distortions that internal power struggles can generate in the allocation of resources between divisions of a diversified firm. The model predicts that if divisions are similar in the level of their resources and opportunities, funds will be transferred from divisions with poor opportunities to divisions with good opportunities. When diversity in resources and opportunities increases, however, resources can flow toward the most inefficient division, leading to more inefficient investment and less valuable firms. We test these predictions on a panel of diversified U.S. firms during the period from 1980 to 1993 and find evidence consistent with them.},

abstract = {When the Revelation Principle (RP) holds, managing earnings confers no advantage over revelation. We construct an explanation for earnings management that is based on limitations on ownersâ ability to make commitments (a violation of the RPâs assumptions). Traditionally, earnings management is seen as sneaky managers pulling the wool over the eyes of gullible owners by manipulating accruals; our limited commitment story suggests that the owners, too, can benefit from earnings management. We categorize a variety of extant explanations of earnings management, along with our own, according to which of the assumptions of the RP each explanation violates. Plausibility of multiple simultaneous violations of the assumptions, and strategic use of various accounting and real instruments of earnings management, complicate the task of detecting such management in field data.},

Further, we show that bellwether firms provide timely information about both industry-specific events and broader economic events.

abstract = {This paper investigates an important contemporary issue relating to the involvement of hedge funds in the syndicated loan market. In particular, we investigate the potential conflicts of interest that arise when hedge funds make syndicated loans and take short positions in the equity of borrowing firms. We find evidence consistent with the short-selling of the equity of the hedge fund borrowers prior to public announcements of both loan originations and loan amendments. We also find that hedge funds are more likely to lend to highly leveraged, lower credit quality firms, where access to private information is potentially the most valuable and where trading on such information could lead to enhanced profits. Overall, our results have important implications for the current debate regarding regulating the hedge fund industry. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We examine ways in which debt contracts are written to control the conflict between bondholders and stockholders. We find that extensive direct restrictions on production/investment policy would be expensive to employ and are not observed. However, dividend and financing policy restrictions are written to give stockholders incentives to follow a firm-value-maximizing production/investment policy. Taking into account how contracts control the bondholder- stockholder conflict leads to a number of testable propositions about the specific form of the debt contract that a firm will choose.},

abstract = {Insider trading in the credit derivatives market has become a significant concern for regulators and participants. This paper attempts to quantify the problem. Using news reflected in the stock market as a benchmark for public information, we find significant incremental information revelation in the credit default swap market under circumstances consistent with the use of non-public information by informed banks. The information revelation occurs only for negative credit news and for entities that subsequently experience adverse shocks, and increases with the number of a firm's relationship banks. We find no evidence, however, that the degree of asymmetric information adversely affects prices or liquidity in either the equity or credit markets.},

@article{Ivashina2011a,
abstract = {One of the most important developments in the corporate loan market over the past decade has been the growing participation of institutional investors. As lenders, institutional investors routinely receive private information about borrowers. However, most of these investors also trade in public securities. This leads to a controversial question: Do institutional investors use private information acquired in the loan market to trade in public securities? This paper examines the stock trading of institutional investors whose portfolios also hold loans. Using the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of loan amendments, we identify institutional investors with access to private information disclosed during loan amendments. We then look at abnormal returns on subsequent stock trades. We find that institutional participants in loan renegotiations subsequently trade in the stock of the same company and outperform trades by other managers and trades in other stocks by approximately 5.4\% in annualized terms. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Bernardo2004,
abstract = {We examine optimal capital allocation and managerial compensation in a firm with two investment projects (divisions) each run by a risk-neutral manager who can provide (i) (unverifiable) information about project quality and (ii) (unverifiable) access to value-enhancing, but privately costly resources. The optimal managerial compensation contract offers greater performance pay and a lower salary when managers report that their project is higher quality. The firm generally underinvests in capital and managers underutilize resources (relative to first-best). We also derive cross-sectional predictions about the sensitivity of investment in one division to the quality of investment opportunities in the other division, and the relative importance of division-level and firm-level performance-based pay in managerial compensation contracts.
