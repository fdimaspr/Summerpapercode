abstract = {This study uses Ohlson’s (1995 and 2001) accounting-based equity $\backslash$nvaluation model to structure tests of four explanations for the anomalously posi- $\backslash$ntive pricing of dividends reported by Rees (1997) and Fama and French (1998). $\backslash$nFirst, we find that dividends are not simply a proxy for publicly available informa- $\backslash$ntion that helps predict future abnormal earnings. Second, although dividends act $\backslash$nas if they signal managers’ private information about future profitability, they $\backslash$nremain positively priced for firms with low incentives to signal. Third, dividends $\backslash$ndo not signal management’s willingness to abstain from incurring agency costs. $\backslash$nFourth, however, controlling for one-year-ahead realized forecast errors yields a $\backslash$npricing of dividends that is very close to that of dividend displacement. After $\backslash$nshowing that dividends are not simply a proxy for analysts’ misforecasting, we $\backslash$nconclude that dividends appear to bepositively priced because they are a proxy for $\backslash$nthemispricing by investors of current earnings or book equity.},
