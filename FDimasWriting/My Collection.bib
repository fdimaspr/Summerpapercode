abstract = {This discussion reflects on the state and future of empirical tax research in accounting, complementing and extending the work of Shackelford and Shevlin (J. Acc. Econom. 31/32 (2001)). Specifically, this discussion (1) examines the scope of Shackelford and Shevlin (J. Acc. Econom. 31/32 (2001)), (2) discusses what I view to be the main contributions and limitations in the extant tax research, and (3) charts several directions for future research. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
