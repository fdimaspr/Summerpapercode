abstract = { This paper investigates associations between top management team incentive dispersion and firm value/performance. We conceptualize team incentive dispersion as arising from the intricate structure of relations across executives’ individual pay packages. Our central focus is on dispersion in pay-performance sensitivities (PPS) across top executives. While existing theory demonstrates that variation in PPS across team members can be optimal, we find that PPS dispersion is negatively associated with firm value as measured by Tobin’s Q and with operating performance (ROA). Further, we find that PPS dispersion significantly weakens the positive effects of both tournament incentives and average team PPS, and significantly exacerbates the negative performance implications associated with CEO pay slice. We conjecture that PPS dispersion promotes free-riding behavior that interferes with executives’ incentives to cooperate. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the negative effects of PPS dispersion are weakened as the duration of the team’s tenure increases or as firm complexity decreases, suggesting that improved (or better) cooperation within the management team over time (or cross firms) offsets the deleterious effects of PPS dispersion.},
