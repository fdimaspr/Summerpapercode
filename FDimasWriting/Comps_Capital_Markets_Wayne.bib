@article{Bernard1989,
abstract = {The article focuses on the delayed price response in post-earnings-announcement drift. It states that competing explanations for post-earnings-announcement drift can be placed in two categories: price response to new information is delayed, and that researches fail to adjust raw returns fully for risk due to the use of incomplete or misestimated capital-asset-pricing models (CAPM) to calculate abnormal returns. It summarizes the current state of understanding for post-earnings-announcement drift and comments on delayed price response and CAPM misspecification to explain the drift. It examines the sample and some of the methods used in empirical tests.},

The authors state that accounting theorists have generally evaluated the usefulness of accounting practices by the extent of their agreement with a particular analytic model. They explain that the model may consist of only a few assertions or it may be a rigorously developed argument. The article says that in each case, the method of evaluation has been to compare existing practices with the more preferable practices implied by the model or with some standard which the model implies all practices should possess.},

Two owners' equity accounting constructs provide the underpinnings of the model: the clean surplus relation applies, and dividends reduce current book value but do not affect current earnings. The model satisfies many appealing properties, and it provides a useful benchmark when one conceptualizes how market value relates to accounting data and other information.},

@misc{Lundholm1995,
abstract = {In a variety of biomedical applications, particularly those involving screening for infectious diseases, testing individuals (e.g. blood/urine samples, etc.) in pools has become a standard method of data collection. This experimental design, known as group testing (or pooled testing), can provide a large reduction in testing costs and can offer nearly the same precision as individual testing. To account for covariate information on individual subjects, regression models for group testing data have been proposed recently. However, there are currently no tools available to check the adequacy of these models. In this paper, we present various global goodness-of-fit tests for regression models with group testing data. We use simulation to examine the small-sample size and power properties of the tests for different pool composition strategies. We illustrate our methods using two infectious disease data sets, one from an HIV study in Kenya and one from the Infertility Prevention Project. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@misc{Miller1966,
abstract = {In this section we have attempted to apply and to test the model of valuation developed in Sections I and II of this paper. Strong support has been presented for our contention that the usual direct least-squares value equations (and yield-form equations) lead to biased estimates of the key parameters. The evidence has also been seen to be consistent with our specifications with respect to the constant terms, the value of the debt coefficient and the role of dividends. Given these specifications, the most efficient, consistent estimates of the value relation are those shown in the second panel of Table 3; and it is to the economic interpretation of these results that we now turn.
